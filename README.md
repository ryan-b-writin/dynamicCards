# Dynamic Cards

## How to use:
> Enter any or no text into the text input at the top left and click 'Create!'
> A card headed by your input text will be printed to the DOM.
> Click 'delete' on any card to remove it.

## Instructions

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. You decide the height/width of the card.
1. When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually [removed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) from the DOM.
